# Corne

This is not a supported QMK configuration. 

This is a saved keymap for my keebmaker built corne42. 

Do not try to flash this to a keyboard - just load it into via instead. 


## Process

1. Open [via configurator](https://usevia.app/). 
1. Authorize via to connect to the corne keyboard
1. Load this layout
1. Make any changes required
1. Save the changed file, add a new version of the keymap here
